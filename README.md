## Why Vanilla JS/CSS/HTML?

In an age where frameworks dominate web development, this project is intentionally built using **vanilla JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**. For small projects that don't require complex features or scaling, frameworks can add unnecessary overhead. Keeping it simple ensures better performance and readability.
